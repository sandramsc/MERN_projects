# Folium-Web-App-Earthquake-Data-Vizualiser

This application was created with earthquake data from USGS and its main feature is to display 
a visual representation of all earthquakes happening in the world in the past day, while emplifying 
the magnitude of those earthquakes with a filled in circular pink ring.
